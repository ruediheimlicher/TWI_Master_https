 * Title: I2C interface based on the AVR Two-Wire Interface (TWI) hardware
 * Description : I2C ("eye-squared-see") is a two-wire bidirectional 
 *               communication interface. It was invented by Philips and
 *               they have protected this name. This is why other manufactures
 *               use a different name for the same protocol.
 *
 *               The two wires are called SDA and SCL. The SCL is the clock
 *               line which is controlled by the master on the i2c bus.
 *
 *  		 SCL is pin PC5 and SDA is pin PC4 for an Atmega8
